# The Ship of Theseus – Rogue-like Text-Based Game

Welcome to *The Ship of Theseus*, a text-based rogue-like game developed in Java using object-oriented programming principles. This project is built on a custom game engine and expands the core gameplay with new interactive features, teleportation mechanics, and additional locations to explore.

## Overview

The player controls an intern who collects scrap across different maps, sells items at a factory, and interacts with a futuristic computer terminal for travel and item purchases.

### Features
- Multiple maps including **Polymorphia**, **Factory's Spaceship Parking Lot**, and a **New Moon**.
- **Computer Terminal** interactions for:
  - Map transitions
  - Purchasing items (including a portable teleporter)
- **THESEUS** – a teleporter item that randomly teleports the player **within the current map**.
- A structured UI rendering system to visualize the map as text.

## Game Design Concepts
- Object-Oriented Design: Implements abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to model game elements such as actors, items, and maps.
- Map navigation and object interaction logic.
- Modular structure allowing easy expansion of game mechanics.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- **Version Control**: Git (repo hosted on Monash GitLab)
- **Design Notation**: UML (class diagrams used for architecture)
